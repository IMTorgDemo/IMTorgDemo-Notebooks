    "I'm a big fan of using cloud environments, especially for getting a product started.  But for early prototyping with a small team, remembering everything that needs to be created / configured, as well as everything that is already performed, can be daunting.  To improve this process, I've started using visual tools to help document my work.  This is a reasonable approach because most aspects of the infrastructure should have a corresponding physical implementation.  In addition, a really mature tool should do alot of this automatically.  We will review some of these tool options for AWS in this post."

    "The Cloud Formation Template is the blueprint for an AWS deployment.  It is a single file (.yaml or .json) that AWS can use to create a new infrastructure.  Along with the hardware, essential attributes, such as security access configs, are included.  Tags can also be included for customized tracking.  \n",

    "In addition to this listing, you can export a template from an existing deployment, called a 'stack', using the Cloud Former service.  Unfortunately, this is only useful for a very [small subset of AWS services](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62943396/which-aws-services-does-aws-cloudformer-support).  A third-party tool, [Former2](https://github.com/iann0036/former2) interacts with the Javascript API to generate your template.  It is open-source and appears to still be maintained.\n",

    "This is exactly why Cloud Formation Designer and Cloud Mapper (open source) were created.  They both work really well and the open-source version seems to be actively maintained.  For more aesthetics, you can use Infviz.io, but you will not be able to update the template."
