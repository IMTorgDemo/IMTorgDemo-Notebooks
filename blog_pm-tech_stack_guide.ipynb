    "## Jira \n",
    "\n",
    "Jira is one of the oldest applications for applying Agile to a Team's workflow.  This is a really simple tool that comes across as overly-complicated because of all the available functionality.  Stop trying to appease your corporate masters, Atlassian!  New and simplified UIs are rolling-out to fix this.  Jira is free for teams, up to 7 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being so mature and well-established, Jira is really showing its age.  For reasons why Jira is obsolete, and for improved alternatives, see the site [whyjirasucks](https://whyjirasucks.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jira can be confusing because of changes to both the UI and available project templates.  We will keep things simple by staying with the 'Classic' project with 'Scrum' template.  This provides the Scrum board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done.  There are two ways to use Jira: basic To Do list, and expected Agile Sprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Items to work on come in three different types: Tasks, Issues, User Stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "You may just want to create simple To Do lists, such as for administrative activities or personal issues.  For this simple use case, just use a Board, which is nothing more than Tasks with a specific Tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create (top ribbon, far-right) \n",
    "* add Summary\n",
    "* set the Assignee\n",
    "* Labels should be the board you want\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view all Tasks with this tag by clicking on Boards, just to the left of Create.  Another way is to \n",
    "* click on 'Boards in this Project'\n",
    "* Create Board \n",
    "* select Scrum or Kanban\n",
    "* Board from saved Filter (JQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jira Query Language (JQL) Filter is just a search for the Label that you associate with the Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agile Sprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Jira for Agile Sprints is the orthodox approach.  Once you have your project, fill-up Tasks in the BackLog.  Move prioritized Tasks into the Sprint area, above, then Create sprint to begin working on those Tasks.  The Tasks will appear on the created sprint board in the To Do column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite useful is the open API that allows you to query the backend of Jira.  I wouldn't invest too much infrastructure with a closed-source tool, but it is definitely good to have available."

In this respect Users still have their own Project listings page, but there are also Groups and Subgroups that allow for better organization of projects.  This is especially useful in allowing access to individuals and teams.\n",
