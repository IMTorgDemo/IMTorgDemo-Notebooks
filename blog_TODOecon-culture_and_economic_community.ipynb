    "A recent short video about [Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXXOGYqbK5o&list=PLWNquNil09IzMqShNLIY5D6WFKirOOjp1&index=33) shows people with little formal education, working in sometimes highly competitive fields, can still participate in the economy because of the informal rules of a communities' culture.  This is even more interesting when juxtaposed with the de-segregation of the 1960s and the integration of black americans into professional life.  While the former uses community members to inject wealth from a larger economy, the later had its most-capable members removed from the community and placed within the larger economy."
