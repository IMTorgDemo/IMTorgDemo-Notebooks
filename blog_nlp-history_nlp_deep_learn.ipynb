    "The automated linguistic annotation of natural languages kept linguists and computer scientists hard at work for many decades.  This work focused on the syntax of language as well as basic understanding and includes part-of-speech, named entity categorization, and syntatic dependency.  Language meta-data tagging became much more accurate with the introduction of neural network and deep learning models.  Because pairing meta-data with more powerful models is sure to allow for an explosion of new applications, it is important to understand the developments that allowed for the creation of this technology.\n",

    "Neuron built by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts Mcculoch-Pitts, who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value, and otherwise outputs a 0, can model the basic OR/AND/NOT functions [ref](http://www.minicomplexity.org/pubs/1943-mcculloch-pitts-bmb.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "A psychologist, Rosenblatt conceived of the Perceptron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate: it takes a set of binary inputs (nearby neurons), multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight (the synapse strength to each nearby neuron), and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 (in the same way neurons either fire or do not) [ref](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1959-09865-001).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons - concisely stated as Hebb’s Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple outputs can be learned by having multiple Perceptrons in a layer, such that all these Perceptrons receive the same input and each one is responsible for one output of the function. Indeed, neural nets (or, formally, ‘Artificial Neural Networks’ - ANNs) are nothing more than layers of Perceptrons.  Only one of the 10 neurons output 1, the highest weighted sum is taken to be the correct output, and the rest output 0.  Finding the right weights using the derivatives of the training error with respect to each weight is exactly how neural nets are typically trained to this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minsky and Papert’s 1969 analysis of Perceptrons did not merely show the impossibility of computing XOR with a single Perceptron, but specifically argued that it had to be done with multiple layers of Perceptrons. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason hidden layers are good, in basic terms, is that the hidden layers can find features within the data and allow following layers to operate on those features rather than the noisy and large raw data.  Similar to Feature Extraction in machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How to get weights for these hidden layers?  Calculus' Chain Rule - The key realization was that if the neural net neurons were not quite Perceptrons, but were made to compute the output with an activation function that was still non-linear but also differentiable, as with Adaline, not only could the derivative be used to adjust the weight to minimize error, but the chain rule could also be used to compute the derivative for all the neurons in a prior layer and thus the way to adjust their weights would also be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign some error to the Output Layer, then some to Hidden Layer before it, and Hidden Layer before it - __backpropagate__ the error.  Werbos stated it in his 1974 PHD thesis, but did not publish on the application of backprop to neural nets until 1982.  [“Learning internal representations by error propagation” ](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/ift3395/lectures/backprop_old.pdf), specifically addressed the problems discussed by Minsky in Perceptrons. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first hidden layer of the neural net was convolutional - instead of each neuron having a different weight for each pixel of the input image (40x60=2400 weights), the neurons only have a small set of weights (5x5=25) that were applied a whole bunch of small subsets of the image of the same size.  a single neuron could learn to detect 45 degree lines on subsets of the image and do that everywhere within it.\n",
    "\n",

    "To tackle the problem of understanding speech, researchers sought to modify neural nets to process input as a stream of input as in speech rather than one batch as with an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the networks that have been discussed so far have been feedforward networks, meaning that the output of neurons in a given layer acts as input to only neurons in a next layer. But, it does not have to be so - there is nothing prohibiting us brave computer scientists from connecting output of the last layer act as an input to the first layer, or just connecting the output of a neuron to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is backpropagation through time. Basically, the idea is to ‘unroll’ the recurrent neural network by treating each loop through the neural network as an input to another neural network, and looping only a limited number of times.  But there was a problem.  Although recurrent networks can outperform static networks, they appear more difficult to train optimally. Their parameters settle in a suboptimal solution which takes into account short term dependencies but not long term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core reason that recurrent nets are more exciting than CNN is that they allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: Sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both. \n",

Each CEC uses as an activation function f, the identity function, and has a connection to itself with ﬁxed weight of 1.0. Due to f’s constant derivative of 1.0, errors backpropagated through a CEC cannot vanish or explode (Sec. 5.9) but stay as they are (unless they “ﬂow out” of the CEC to other, typically adaptive parts of the NN).\n",

    "In 2004, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) decided to “rebrand” the frowned-upon field of neural nets with the moniker “Deep Learning”.  In 2006, the paper [](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/fastnc.pdf) was released which provided a way to train weights well, if the weights are initialized in a clever way rather than randomly.  The basic idea is to train each layer, as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), one by one with unsupervised training, which starts off the weights much better than just giving them random values, and then finishing with a round of supervised learning just as is normal for neural nets. \n",

Also, using RBMs is not that important - unsupervised pre-training of normal neural net layers using backpropagation with plain Autoencoders layers proved to also work well. \n",

It also enabled transfer learning through re-use of weights, achieving good performance with as little as one positive example per category (Donahue et al., 2014).
